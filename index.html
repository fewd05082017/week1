    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>Hello, My name is Rubayet. I was born in Bangladesh. I am a Biology graduate who initially wanted to pursue a career in Health Scince and Medicine. I decided to change direcion to try something else. I love playing sports such as basketball, football and soccer. I also love doing extreme things such as sky diving, zip lining and cliff diving. I enjoy listening to various genres of music. I am very outgoing and love traveling to exotic and beautiful places. I am very friendly and nice to people, and love making new friends everywhere I travel. </p>

    <p>The reason I chose Web Development is besides Science and Mathematics, I also love Computer Science and Programming. Web Development always interested me while I was doing my undergraduate studies. I was very much fascinated how webpages and websites were developed. WHich is one reason I decided to take Front-End Web Developement course. I hope that after taking this class it will further help me become a good web developer and programmer.</p>
